# 🌾 Crop Disease Classification Using CNN & Transfer Learning  
### **WorldQuant University – Deep Learning for Computer Vision Lab (Project 2)**

This repository contains my second project for the **Deep Learning for Computer Vision Lab** at **WorldQuant University**. The project focuses on building and optimizing convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to classify crop disease images collected from agricultural fields in Uganda. It demonstrates a full computer vision workflow including dataset analysis, baseline modeling, transfer learning, performance evaluation, and training optimization using callbacks.
