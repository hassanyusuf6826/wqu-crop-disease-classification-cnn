# 📌 Project: Crop Disease Classification Using CNN & Transfer Learning

WorldQuant University – Deep Learning for Computer Vision Lab (Project 2)

This repository contains my second project for the Deep Learning for Computer Vision Lab at WorldQuant University, where I developed and optimized a convolutional neural network (CNN) for classifying crop disease images collected from agricultural fields in Uganda. The goal of this project is to leverage deep learning techniques to support early disease detection and improve agricultural decision-making.

## 🔍 Project Overview

The dataset consists of crop leaf images categorized into five disease classes. This project walks through the complete workflow of a modern image classification pipeline—from data exploration and modeling to performance optimization and evaluation.

## 🧠 Key Learning Objectives

By completing this project, I gained hands-on experience in:

Exploring a crop disease image dataset

Building and training a CNN for multi-class image classification

Improving model performance using Transfer Learning with pre-trained architectures

Identifying and mitigating overfitting

Applying k-fold cross-validation to evaluate model stability

Using essential training Callbacks, including:

Learning Rate Scheduling

Model Checkpointing

Early Stopping

⚙️ Techniques & Tools Used

Python, Pytorch

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

Transfer Learning (e.g., EfficientNet, MobileNet, ResNet—depending on your choice)

Callbacks for training optimization

Data augmentation

k-fold cross-validation

GPU-accelerated training (if available)
